ðŸ¤– Chatbot Description

A chatbot is a software application designed to simulate human-like conversation with users, often using natural language processing and artificial intelligence. It can interact via text or voice across various platforms like websites, messaging apps, or smart devices. Chatbots are typically used for tasks such as customer support, information retrieval, scheduling, or even just casual conversation. Some are rule-based with pre-programmed responses, while othersâ€”like me!â€”are powered by advanced AI to provide more dynamic, personalized, and contextual replies.
